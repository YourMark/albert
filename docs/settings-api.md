# Albert Settings API

Albert ships a single **Settings** admin screen that Free and every add-on
contribute to. Free renders one `<form>`, validates one nonce, runs one save
loop, and persists each field to `wp_options`.

There are two APIs:

1. **`albert_register_setting()`** — the simple, public API add-ons should use.
   Registers a single field on the shared Albert Settings card.
2. **`albert_register_settings_section()`** — the advanced API for add-ons that
   need a whole card of their own (custom render callbacks, conditional
   visibility, etc.). Free uses it internally for the Licenses card.

## Public API: `albert_register_setting()`

Hook `albert/settings/register` and register each setting as a flat array:

```php
add_action( 'albert/settings/register', static function (): void {
    if ( ! function_exists( 'albert_register_setting' ) ) {
        return;
    }

    albert_register_setting( [
        'title'       => __( 'Retention (days)', 'albert-premium-service' ),
        'option_name' => 'premium_activity_log_retention_days',
        'type'        => 'number',
        'description' => __( 'How long to keep activity log entries before pruning.', 'albert-premium-service' ),
        'default'     => 30,
        'attributes'  => [ 'min' => 1, 'max' => 365, 'step' => 1 ],
        'badge'       => __( 'Premium', 'albert-premium-service' ),
    ] );
} );
```

Read the saved value anywhere with:

```php
$retention = (int) get_option( 'premium_activity_log_retention_days', 30 );
```

### Schema

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| `title` | string | **yes** | Visible label above the input. |
| `option_name` | string | **yes** | Exact `wp_options` key used for storage. |
| `type` | string | **yes** | One of `text`, `url`, `number`, `textarea`, `select`, `checkbox`, `radio-cards`. |
| `description` | string | no | Help text rendered with the label. Keep it to one line and put the rest in `info`. |
| `default` | mixed | no | Returned when no value is stored. Also registered with WordPress, so `get_option()` serves it without callers restating it — on admin requests; see *Storage* below. |
| `options` | array | **yes for `select` and `radio-cards`** | `value => label` pairs for `select`; for `radio-cards`, `value => [ 'label' =>, 'description' =>, 'recommended' => ]`. |
| `attributes` | array | no | Extra HTML attributes (e.g. `placeholder`, `min`, `max`, `step`). Reserved keys (`name`, `id`, `type`, `value`, `checked`) are ignored. |
| `badge` | string | no | Small pill rendered next to the label (e.g. `"Premium"`). |
| `suffix` | string | no | The unit shown beside the control ("days", "MB"), tied to it with `aria-describedby`. |
| `info` | string | no | Text for an info "(i)" beside the label, for the detail that will not fit on the description's one line. May contain `<code>`. |
| `section` | string | no | Id of the card to land in. Must be namespaced (`myplugin/logging`). *Since 1.4.0.* |
| `section_title` | string | no | Creates the card named by `section` if it does not exist yet, with this heading. *Since 1.4.0.* |
| `section_priority` | int | no | Orders that card against the rest (default `50`; Free's own run 60–68, Licenses last at 9000). *Since 1.4.0.* |

### Where the field lands

Give your settings a heading that says what they are about. One call does it:

```php
albert_register_setting( [
    'title'         => __( 'Log retention', 'my-addon' ),
    'suffix'        => __( 'days', 'my-addon' ),
    'option_name'   => 'my_addon_log_retention_days',
    'type'          => 'number',
    'min'           => 0,
    'max'           => 3650,
    'section'       => 'my-addon/logging',
    'section_title' => __( 'Logging', 'my-addon' ),
] );
```

Every later field naming `my-addon/logging` joins that card — including one
registered by a different add-on, which is how two plugins can share a heading
rather than each growing their own. Naming a card that already exists (one of
Free's, such as `albert/connections`) adds to it instead.

Omit `section` and the field goes to a shared card titled **Other**. That exists
so an add-on written against 1.1.0 keeps working; it is not the place to aim
for. It cannot be named after what is inside it, because it holds whatever
nobody placed — a heading borrowed from the first occupant is wrong the moment
an unrelated second setting lands beside it.

Missing a required key — or registering a `select` without `options` — logs a
`_doing_it_wrong()` notice and skips the field.

### Built-in field types

| Type | Renders | Default sanitizer |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `text` | `<input type="text">` | `sanitize_text_field` |
| `url` | `<input type="url">` | `esc_url_raw` then `rtrim($v, '/')` |
| `number` | `<input type="number">` | `absint` (or `floatval` when `attributes.step` contains `.`) |
| `textarea` | `<textarea>` | `sanitize_textarea_field` |
| `select` | `<select>` | Validates against `options` keys; falls back to `default`. |
| `checkbox` | hidden `0` + visible `1` | Bool — `true` only when raw value is `'1' / 1 / true`. |

The checkbox renders a paired hidden input so unchecked submissions still
post a `0`. Without it WordPress would never know the user unchecked the box.

## Styling (1.4.0+)

Anything rendered through this API inherits Albert's design system — you do not
style it yourself, and you should not need to. Fields, sections and the page
shell are drawn with the shared primitives, so a setting registered by an add-on
looks identical to a core one and follows the admin colour scheme.

If an add-on renders its own screen under the Albert menu, declare the shared
stylesheet as a dependency rather than restating any value:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( 'my-screen', $url, [ 'albert-primitives' ], $version );
```

Use the literal handle, not `Albert\Admin\Assets::PRIMITIVES_HANDLE`, so an
older Albert without that class cannot fatal your plugin. Every token and
primitive is listed in `docs/design-system.md`; the add-on contract, including
menu ordering, is in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Rendering your own `add_settings_error()` notices on a custom admin page under
the Albert menu? Use `Albert\Admin\Notices::render( $group )` rather than
calling `settings_errors( $group )` directly — it wraps the same output in
`aria-live="polite"`, which WordPress's own function does not do on its own,
so a notice announces itself to a screen reader identically wherever it
appears in Albert.

## Storage: WordPress owns the option, Albert owns the screen (1.4.0+)

Every field registered through this API is handed to WordPress's
`register_setting()` by `Albert\Admin\Settings\Storage`. Only the storage half
of WordPress's Settings API is used — `add_settings_field()`,
`do_settings_sections()` and `settings_fields()` are never called, so no
WordPress markup reaches the screen. Albert renders every control itself and the
form posts to `admin-post.php` with its own nonce.

**What this changes for you.** Your `sanitize_callback` now runs on *every*
write to the option, not just on the settings-form POST, because
`register_setting()` hooks `sanitize_option_{$option}` and `update_option()`
applies it. An invalid value can no longer be stored by code that bypasses the
form. Your declared `default` is also served by `get_option()` without callers
passing one, so a default no longer has to be repeated in the class that reads
it.

**Two consequences worth knowing.**

*Sanitisers must be idempotent.* The save loop sanitises, then
`update_option()` sanitises the result again. A callback must return clean
input unchanged and must not repeat a side effect (such as an
`add_settings_error()`) on the second pass.

*The guarantee is admin-only.* Registration runs on `admin_init`, so it covers
admin requests, admin-ajax and the settings POST — **not** WP-Cron and not
WP-CLI. Two practical rules follow:

- Do not assume a value written by cron or WP-CLI was sanitised.
- **Keep passing an explicit default to `get_option()`** in code that can run
  outside admin. The registered default does not exist there, so
  `get_option( 'your_option' )` returns `false`. Free's own cron sweeps and MCP
  request paths all still pass their defaults, with a comment saying why.

Registration is skipped for a read-only `custom` field (one whose
`sanitize_callback` is `'__return_null'`), because it stores nothing.

`show_in_rest` is opt-in per field and defaults to `false`; a setting is not
exposed over REST merely because it exists.

## MCP external URL filter

The MCP endpoint URL is rendered on the **Connections** screen. There is no
admin input for overriding it — sites that need a different host (tunnels,
reverse proxies, local development) hook the `albert/mcp/external_url`
filter:

```php
add_filter( 'albert/mcp/external_url', static function (): string {
    if ( defined( 'WP_ENV' ) && WP_ENV === 'development' ) {
        return 'https://albert.test';
    }
    return '';
} );
```

The filter must return a fully-qualified URL including the scheme
(`https://…` or `http://…`). Return an empty string to disable the override
and use `rest_url()` as normal.

Returned values are validated with `wp_http_validate_url()`. If the filter
returns a non-empty string that fails validation, Albert logs a
`_doing_it_wrong()` notice, falls back to the default endpoint, and the
Connections screen displays a warning explaining what is wrong.

## Advanced API: `albert_register_settings_section()`

Use this when a single field isn't enough — for example an activity log card
that includes a table plus two controls, or a feature toggle that pulls in a
custom render callback.

```php
add_action( 'albert/settings/register', static function (): void {
    if ( ! function_exists( 'albert_register_settings_section' ) ) {
        return;
    }

    albert_register_settings_section( [
        'id'         => 'premium/activity-log',
        'title'      => __( 'Activity Log', 'albert-premium-service' ),
        'priority'   => 20,
        'icon'       => 'list-view',
        'badge'      => __( 'Premium', 'albert-premium-service' ),
        'show_if'    => static fn (): bool => albert_has_valid_license( 'albert-premium-service' ),
        'capability' => 'manage_options',
        'fields'     => [
            [
                'id'      => 'enabled',
                'type'    => 'checkbox',
                'label'   => __( 'Enable activity log', 'albert-premium-service' ),
                'default' => true,
            ],
            [
                'id'          => 'retention_days',
                'type'        => 'number',
                'label'       => __( 'Retention (days)', 'albert-premium-service' ),
                'default'     => 30,
                'attributes'  => [ 'min' => 1, 'max' => 365, 'step' => 1 ],
                'show_if'     => static fn (): bool => (bool) get_option( 'premium_activity_log_enabled', true ),
            ],
        ],
    ] );
} );
```

### Section schema

| Key | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `id` | string | yes | — | Must contain `/` (namespace prefix). Reused id replaces the previous section. |
| `title` | string | yes | — | Heading shown in the section card. |
| `description` | string | no | `''` | Short paragraph below the title. |
| `priority` | int | no | `10` | Lower runs earlier. Free uses 50 for the shared Settings card and 9000 for Licenses. |
| `show_if` | callable | no | always-true | Returning `false` skips the section for both render and save. |
| `icon` | string | no | `''` | Dashicon slug **without** the `dashicons-` prefix. |
| `badge` | string | no | `''` | Pill rendered next to the title. |
| `capability` | string | no | `'manage_options'` | Required capability to view and save the section. |
| `fields` | array | yes | — | Indexed list of field arrays (see below). |

### Section-field schema

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | string | yes | Combined with the section id to form the option name (slashes → underscores). |
| `type` | string | yes | One of `text`, `url`, `number`, `textarea`, `select`, `checkbox`, `radio-cards`, `custom`. |
| `label` | string | yes (except `custom`) | Visible label above the input. Custom fields may pass `''`. |
| `description` | string | no | Help text. |
| `default` | mixed | no | Returned when no value is stored. |
| `badge` | string | no | Pill rendered next to the label. |
| `show_if` | callable | no | Field-level conditional (same semantics as section `show_if`). |
| `render_callback` | callable | yes for `custom` | `function(array $field, mixed $current_value): void` — echo input HTML only. |
| `sanitize_callback` | callable | yes for `custom`, optional override otherwise | `function(mixed $raw): mixed`. Use `'__return_null'` to mark a custom field read-only. |
| `options` | array | yes for `select` | `value => label` pairs. |
| `attributes` | array | no | Extra HTML attributes (e.g. `placeholder`, `step`). |
| `min` / `max` | int\|float | no | The allowed range for a `number` field. Drives **both** the control's attributes and the sanitiser, so a value outside it cannot be stored, whatever posted it. Declaring them under `attributes` works identically and is what fields did before 1.4.0. *Since 1.4.0.* |
| `option_name` | string | no | Use a literal `wp_options` key instead of the auto-generated one. |
| `suffix` | string | no | The unit shown beside the control ("days", "MB"). Associated with it via `aria-describedby`, so "90" and "90 days" are not the same field to a screen reader. |
| `info` | string | no | Text for an info "(i)" beside the label. **Keep `description` to one line and put the rest here** — the edge case, the consequence, what `0` does. May contain `<code>`. The description must still read correctly without opening it. |
| `disabled` | bool\|callable | no | Renders the control read-only. Rarely needed: an active constant or filter does this on its own (see below). Use it for a condition the resolver cannot see. A callable is evaluated at render time, so a field declares the *condition* rather than a snapshot. |
| `hint` | array\|callable | no | `[ 'text' => string, 'tone' => 'info'\|'warning' ]`, shown under the control. A callable may return `null` when there is nothing to say. `text` may contain `<code>` and nothing else. An overridden field generates its own hint, so supply one only when you can say more. |
| `display_value` | callable | no | `function( mixed $stored ): mixed` — what to *show*, when that differs from what is stored. An override is displayed automatically; this is the escape hatch for a value the resolver cannot express. |

### Bounded numbers

`min` and `max` are enforced, not decorative. They used to reach the `<input>`
and stop there, which meant the browser was the only thing holding the line: a
field declaring `max => 3650` accepted 99999 from a crafted POST, and — now that
options are registered — from any `update_option()` call as well.

Clamping is also *said*. Rewriting somebody's 99999 to 3650 without a word
leaves them looking at a number they did not type, so the sanitiser raises a
warning naming both values. That behaviour existed as a one-off on Free's upload
size limit; it is now what every bounded number field does.

One consequence worth knowing: without a declared `min`, a number field is run
through `absint()`, so `-5` is stored as `5`. **With** a `min`, the declaration
is treated as the authority on the lower bound and `-5` clamps to it. Declare
`min => 0` rather than relying on `absint()` if what you mean is "not negative".

### When something else owns the value

A setting can be decided by a `wp-config.php` constant or by a filter rather
than by the stored option. When one is, the control renders read-only and says
where the value comes from: a box somebody can type into and save, whose value
code then discards, is a lie about what the site does.

**You do not declare any of this.** `Albert\Admin\Settings\Value` resolves it
and `SettingsRenderer` reacts, so a new overridable setting is an ordinary field
definition and nothing more. Free's upload size limit used to carry three
callbacks (`max_mb_is_filtered`, `max_mb_display_value`, `max_mb_hint`) to say
"a filter is overriding this"; two of them are gone, and only the hint remains,
because only that field can state the exact size in force — the control rounds
up to whole megabytes, so 500 KB would otherwise show as "1 MB" with nothing to
correct the impression.

The chain, highest priority first:

1. **A constant** named after the option in upper case: `albert_privacy_mode` is
   pinned by `ALBERT_PRIVACY_MODE`.
2. **The filter `albert/settings/value/{option_name}`**, returning `null` to
   defer.
3. **The stored option**, then the declared default.

Read a setting with the helper rather than `get_option()` when you want the
value actually in force:

```php
$mode = albert_get_setting( 'albert_privacy_mode', 'balanced' );
```

**Bridging a filter you already publish.** A domain-specific filter name reads
better at a call site than a generic one, so Albert's own two are not
deprecated: `albert/privacy/mode` and `albert/media/upload_link_max_bytes` still
work, and `Settings\Overrides` feeds them into the chain so the screen sees
them. Answer `albert/settings/value_source/{option_name}` with your own hook
name when you do this — otherwise the screen reports the generic hook, which the
site owner will not find anywhere in their code.

```php
add_filter( 'albert/settings/value/my_option', fn ( $v ) => $v ?? apply_filters( 'my/own/filter', null ) );
add_filter( 'albert/settings/value_source/my_option', fn ( $n ) => $n ?? 'my/own/filter' );
```

**An override is not sanitised.** It never passes through `update_option()`, so
nothing runs the field's `sanitize_callback` over it. Pass a validator when the
setting has a closed vocabulary, and a layer it rejects is skipped rather than
accepted — a typo in a constant then falls through to the filter or the stored
value instead of resolving to nonsense:

```php
Value::get( 'albert_privacy_mode', '', fn ( $v ) => PrivacyMode::normalize( (string) $v ) !== null );
```

`disabled`, `hint` and `display_value` remain as manual escape hatches for a
condition the resolver cannot see — a licence state, a network policy — and a
field's own values win over the automatic ones.

### Option name resolution

By default the option name is `{section_id_with_slashes_replaced}_{field_id}`:

| Section id | Field id | Option name |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| `premium/activity-log` | `retention_days` | `premium_activity_log_retention_days` |

Pass an explicit `option_name` to override the auto-generated name.

### Radio cards

`radio-cards` is for a choice important enough to explain rather than list
bare in a `<select>` — Free's own privacy mode is one. `options` takes the
same `value => …` shape `select` does, but each value is an array carrying a
`label`, an optional `description`, and an optional `recommended` flag that
renders a "Recommended" badge:

```php
'type'    => 'radio-cards',
'options' => [
    'strict' => [
        'label'       => __( 'Strict', 'my-addon' ),
        'description' => __( 'Personal data is always anonymised.', 'my-addon' ),
        'recommended' => true,
    ],
    'off'    => [
        'label'       => __( 'Off', 'my-addon' ),
        'description' => __( 'Personal data is passed through as-is.', 'my-addon' ),
    ],
],
```

A bare string value works too (`'off' => __( 'Off', 'my-addon' )`), matching
`select`'s shape when there's nothing to add beyond the label.

### Custom fields

Custom fields are the escape hatch for inputs the built-ins can't model
(license tables, OAuth wizards, copy-to-clipboard widgets). Two callbacks
are required:

```php
'render_callback' => static function ( array $field, mixed $current_value ): void {
    // Echo the input HTML only. No <form>, no submit button, no <label>
    // wrapper (the renderer already added one if `label` is non-empty).
},

'sanitize_callback' => static fn ( $raw ) => is_scalar( $raw ) ? sanitize_text_field( (string) $raw ) : '',
```

For a read-only custom field (display only, never saved), pass
`'__return_null'` as the sanitize callback. The save loop skips persistence
for that field.

If a render callback throws, the renderer catches the error, writes a line
to `error_log`, and prints an inline admin notice in place of the field.

## Hooks reference

| Hook | Type | Fires |
|------|------|-------|
| `albert/settings/register` | action | Before sections are collected. Add-ons hook here. |
| `albert/settings/sections` | filter | Final pass after the registry returns its list. |
| `albert/settings/saved` | action | After a successful save. Receives `array<option_name, sanitized_value>`. |
| `albert/mcp/external_url` | filter | Return a fully-qualified URL to override the MCP endpoint host. Empty string disables the override. Invalid URLs are ignored. |

## Versioning / feature detection

The functions live in Free. Add-ons that may load against an older Free
version should guard their calls:

```php
if ( ! function_exists( 'albert_register_setting' ) ) {
    return;
}
```
