/**
 * Albert → Context screen.
 *
 * The site owner tells connected assistants what this site is and how to behave.
 *
 * Token counts used to sit alongside every section and in a dedicated cost
 * card, priced by an estimator calibrated against one reference tokeniser.
 * Removed: different assistants tokenise differently, the estimate could only
 * ever be shown as a wide, provider-specific error band, and it did not change
 * what an owner should do, the section descriptions already say what each one
 * includes, well enough to decide on without a number attached. What is
 * actually sent is still shown in full, in the preview card below.
 *
 * Every write returns the full recomputed state, so the screen is always the
 * server's answer rather than the client's guess about what the server would
 * say.
