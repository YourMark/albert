/**
 * Integration tests for the ability counts shown on admin screens.
 *
 * These exist because the Dashboard told every site owner that all of their
 * abilities were enabled, however many they had switched off: the tile read
 * "57 / 57" on a site with 32 disabled, and the "review the ones you switched
 * off" link, which renders only when the two figures differ, could therefore
 * never appear.
 *
 * The cause was ordering rather than arithmetic.
 * `AbilitiesManager::enforce_disabled()` unregisters disabled abilities on
 * every request except the Abilities page, so anything counting the registry
 * afterwards counts only the survivors and calls that the total. Both figures
 * are now taken inside `enforce_disabled()` itself, while the registry is
 * still whole.
 *
 * That is exactly what these tests pin: the reported total must be larger than
 * what is left in the registry once pruning has happened.
