<?php
/**
 * Integration tests for the Dashboard's idea of "connected".
 *
 * The Dashboard used to ask its own question — `revoked = 0` on the access
 * tokens, nothing else — while the Connections screen, both retention sweeps
 * and the Dashboard's own attention card all used
 * {@see ClientRepository::getLiveConnections()}. Its predicate has no expiry
 * check and never looks at a refresh token, so it counted a client whose every
 * token had expired: for up to a day, until `Cron\TokenCleanup` removes the
 * rows, and indefinitely on a site where WP-Cron never runs. A screen reading
 * "1 connection" and offering the finished-setup state over an assistant that
 * cannot call anything is the failure this pins shut.
 *
 * There is a second thing here worth stating, because it is easy to assume the
 * opposite: a refresh token cannot keep a connection visible on its own once
 * the access-token row it points at has been deleted. `getLiveConnections()`
 * selects `FROM access_tokens`, so no row means no connection, everywhere. That
 * is a token-lifecycle question in `ClientRepository`/`Cron\TokenCleanup`
 * rather than anything this screen decides, and the Dashboard's job is only to
 * give the same answer as everything else. That is what
 * {@see self::test_the_dashboard_agrees_with_the_connections_screen()} holds it
 * to.
 *
 * Plus the narrower thing that started it: the count and the names beneath it
 * came from two separate queries and could describe two different sets.
