/**
 * Things worth asking an assistant on this particular site.
 *
 * The hard part of Albert is not connecting it, it is the moment after: an
 * assistant is attached to the site and nobody knows what to say to it. No
 * other screen answers that, and unlike a count of abilities it cannot be
 * derived from the Abilities screen either.
 *
 * **Every suggestion is checked before it is shown.** A prompt names the
 * abilities it needs, and it is listed only when all of them are *available on
 * this site*: registered, and switched on. So the card never recommends
 * something that would fail. That is also what makes it site-specific for free:
 * a shop with the WooCommerce abilities enabled is offered order questions, and
 * a site without them never sees them.
 *
 * **Registered, not merely enabled**, and the distinction is the whole check.
 * `AbilitiesState` answers from a blocklist, so an ability that does not exist
 * on this site has never been switched off and reads as enabled. Asking it
 * alone put "Which products sold best last month?" at the top of the card on
 * every WordPress site in the world, shop or not: Albert only registers the
 * WooCommerce abilities when WooCommerce is active, so on a plain site
 * `albert/woo-find-orders` was simultaneously absent and "enabled".
 *
 * **Name the ability that does the work, not one that is merely nearby.** The
 * check is only as honest as the ids a prompt declares, and the top-sellers
 * prompt is the case that shows it: it named Free's `woo-find-orders` and
 * `woo-find-products`, which between them can list orders and list products
 * and cannot join the two, so it appeared on any shop and answered properly on
 * none. It names `albert-woocommerce/view-top-sellers` now. A Free default
 * naming an add-on's id is not a dependency on the add-on: `requires` is a
 * string checked against the registry, so without the add-on the prompt is
 * simply never listed, which is the whole mechanism working.
 *
 * Registered as data so an add-on contributes a prompt without touching markup.
 *

	/**
	 * The prompts Free ships.
	 *
	 * **A prompt may not presume a fact about the site.** "Find every page that
	 * still mentions our old address" reads well and is useless: it assumes
	 * there was a move, that the old address is still somewhere, and that the
	 * reader knows what it was. Somebody who tries it gets nothing back and
	 * learns that the card makes things up. Every prompt here asks a question
	 * that has a real answer on any site with the abilities it names, whether
	 * that answer is a list or "none".
	 *
	 * The same rule ruled out the other tempting ones. "Which images are
	 * missing alt text?" would be the most useful prompt on this list, but
	 * `albert/find-media` does not return alt text; answering it means a
	 * `view-media` call per attachment, which is not a thing to put in front of
	 * somebody as an example.
	 *
	 * Ordered so the first one that survives filtering is the most
	 * characteristic thing this site can do: commerce on a shop, content
	 * everywhere else.
