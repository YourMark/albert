/**
 * Add-ons worth mentioning, based on what this site actually runs.
 *
 * A shop owner learning that Albert speaks WooCommerce is being told something
 * useful. Everybody else seeing the same card is being advertised at. The
 * difference is entirely whether the host plugin is present, so that is the
 * only thing that decides whether this renders.
 *
 * Rules that keep it a feature rather than an advert, all enforced here rather
 * than left to the caller:
 *
 * - The host plugin must genuinely be active, detected by a symbol it defines.
 * - The add-on must not already be running. Selling somebody what they own is
 *   the fastest way to make a screen untrustworthy.
 * - **Nothing already pitched elsewhere on this screen.** The activity card
 *   owns the Premium story. It is the surface where the loss is visible, so it
 *   can say "this list only goes back a few actions" rather than a generic
 *   pitch, and it handles installed-but-off too. Premium was in this list as
 *   well, with no host plugin to gate it, which meant every Dashboard without
 *   Premium running carried two pitches for it: one specific and true, one
 *   generic and a column away. Two asks for the same thing on one screen is an
 *   advert however good each one reads.
 * - One at a time. A stack of recommendations is a shop, not a dashboard.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "no thanks" control. The card already answers to the
 * only thing that should silence it: install the add-on, or stop running the
 * plugin it is about, and it goes. A dismiss link adds a control whose whole
 * job is to hide something the screen should not be showing in the first place.
 *
 * Entries are data, so Elementor becomes another row here rather than another
 * block of markup somewhere.
