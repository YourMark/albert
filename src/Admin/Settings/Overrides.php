/**
 * Lets Albert's domain-specific override filters feed the generic chain.
 *
 * Two filters predate {@see Value} and are the documented way to pin these
 * settings in code: `albert/privacy/mode` (1.3.0) and
 * `albert/media/upload_link_max_bytes` (1.4.0). Neither is deprecated. A filter
 * named for its subject reads better at the call site than
 * `albert/settings/value/albert_privacy_mode` would, so renaming them to match a
 * generic scheme would make the API worse, not better.
 *
 * What they lacked was a way to tell the Settings screen they were in force.
 * Bridging them onto `albert/settings/value/{option}` fixes that in one place:
 * a site filtering the privacy mode used to see the *stored* value on screen,
 * fully editable, and could save over it without changing what the site did.
 * Now the control renders read-only and says where the value comes from.
 *
 * What decides whether a given override is *usable* is a separate thing and
 * lives in {@see Validators}, deliberately as a static map rather than another
 * set of hooks registered from here. See that class for why.
 *
 * Registered in every context, not just admin — the generic chain is what
 * `albert_get_setting()` reads on MCP and front-end requests too, and a cron
 * sweep resolving a setting differently from the screen that shows it is the
 * bug this class exists to stop.
