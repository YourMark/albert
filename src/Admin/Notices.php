/**
 * The one place every Albert screen renders its queued `add_settings_error()`
 * notices, so a confirmation or warning looks and behaves identically wherever
 * it appears.
 *
 * Two things this does that a bare `settings_errors()` call does not.
 *
 * **It stays where the screen put it.** `wp-admin/js/common.js` runs
 * `$( 'div.updated, div.error, div.notice' ).not( '.inline, .below-h2' )
 * .insertAfter( $headerEnd )` on load, which hoists any notice out of its
 * container and drops it after the page header. A first version of this class
 * wrapped `settings_errors()` and was silently defeated by that: the notice
 * rendered inside the wrapper server-side and core moved it out before anyone
 * saw it. Emitting the markup here, with `inline`, is what opts out of the
 * hoist.
 *
 * **It is actually announced.** The wrapper carries `aria-live="polite"`, which
 * only works if the notice is inside it when the announcement matters — see
 * above. Core's own notice output carries no live region at all.
 *
 * The markup is core's, from `wp_admin_notice()` (WP 6.4+), which is what
 * `settings_errors()` itself calls. An admin notice should look and behave like
 * every other WordPress admin notice, `is-dismissible` is wired by core's JS
 * wherever the node sits, and anything core changes about that markup arrives
 * here for free. All this class decides is *where* the notice goes and that it
 * is announced; it hand-rolled the `<div>` for a while and that was one more
 * copy of core's markup than anybody needed.
