 * every add-on.
 *
 * The tokens are **registered, never enqueued** here. Every screen that needs
 * them names {@see self::TOKENS_HANDLE} in its own stylesheet's dependency
 * array, and WordPress then enqueues the tokens first, automatically, wherever
 * a consumer appears. That is stronger than enqueueing them on every admin page:
 * a screen cannot forget the dependency and still render (its own custom
 * properties would be undefined), and Albert adds no stylesheet to admin pages
 * that are none of its business.
 *
 * Add-ons follow the same contract — declare `'albert-tokens'` as a dependency
 * rather than restating any value:
 *
 *     wp_enqueue_style( 'my-addon', $url, [ 'albert-tokens' ], $version );
 *
 * Registration runs at priority 1 so the handle exists before any screen's own
 * `admin_enqueue_scripts` callback runs at the default priority.
