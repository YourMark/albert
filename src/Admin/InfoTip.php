/**
 * The "(i)" control, for server-rendered screens.
 *
 * One implementation of a control Albert uses everywhere: beside a settings
 * label, a card title, a table heading, a toggle row — anywhere a term sits on
 * the line of common knowledge, or a rule has an edge case that would bloat the
 * sentence next to it.
 *
 * **The rule, from docs/design-system.md:** the sentence must read correctly
 * without opening the tip. It adds the mechanism, the edge case, the
 * consequence. It never carries information the reader needs in order to
 * understand what the control does.
 *
 * This is the server-rendered half of a pair. React screens use
 * `assets/src/shared/InfoPopover.jsx`, which wraps core's `Dropdown` and gets
 * collision detection and focus management from it. The split is by rendering
 * context, never by screen: reaching for this one inside a React tree is how
 * the Context screen once ended up with a second, worse copy of a control the
 * Abilities screen already had.
 *
 * Presentation lives in `albert-primitives.css` (`.albert-tip`) and behaviour
 * in `assets/js/admin-popover.js`, which {@see Assets::enqueue_on_albert_screens()}
 * loads on every Albert screen. Nothing needs enqueueing to use this.
