 * The point of sending these is that a model asked for "a button in our brand
 * colour" should use a colour that exists on the site instead of inventing one.
 * That only works if the values are actually the site's.
 *
 * **Provenance is the whole design.** `wp_get_global_settings()` never comes
 * back empty: WordPress ships its own `theme.json`, so a theme that declares
 * nothing still yields core's generic palette. Handing that to a model dressed
 * as brand tokens is worse than sending nothing, it would confidently paint the
 * site in WordPress's defaults. So every value here is read from the `theme` and
 * `custom` origins only, and the section is omitted when those are empty.
 *
 * Reading by origin is also what makes one gate cover both theme kinds: a block
 * theme's `theme.json` and a classic theme's
 * `add_theme_support( 'editor-color-palette' )` both land in the `theme` origin,
 * and the Styles editor's overrides land in `custom`. No `wp_is_block_theme()`
 * branch is needed, and none is wanted, a block theme without a `theme.json`
 * would pass that check while declaring nothing.
