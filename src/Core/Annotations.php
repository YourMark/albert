/**
 * Annotations class
 *
 * Static factory for ability annotation arrays. The two boolean flags
 * combine into three behavior categories surfaced in the admin UI:
 *
 * - **Read**: `readonly: true, destructive: false`, only reads data.
 * - **Write**: `readonly: false, destructive: false`, creates or updates data.
 * - **Delete**: `readonly: false, destructive: true`, permanently removes data.
 *
 * Every factory takes an optional `instructions` string. It is the guidance that
 * only matters once a model is about to call this particular ability: the
 * argument that is easy to get wrong, the call that has to come first, the thing
 * that looks like it will work and will not.
 *
 * It rides in `meta.annotations.instructions`, which `get-ability-info` returns
 * verbatim. That call is made only when a model is about to use the ability, so
 * the guidance costs nothing until the moment it is worth reading. This is why it
 * lives on the ability rather than in the discovery response, which is read once
 * per conversation whether or not it is needed, or in a long playbook that
 * nothing fetches on its own.
 *
 * Write it as one or two sentences addressed to the caller. It is read at the
 * moment of use, so lead with what to do, not with what the ability is.
