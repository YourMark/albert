	 * Insert a log entry and prune old entries for the ability/status partition.
	 *
	 * Accepts an optional $context array whose keys map to the richer columns
	 * added in 1.2.0. Unknown keys are silently ignored. Free always passes an
	 * empty array; Premium populates the full set.
	 *
	 * Context keys → columns:
	 *   duration_ms   (int|null)    → duration_ms
	 *   failure_stage (string|null) → failure_stage
	 *   user_agent    (string|null) → user_agent
	 *   privacy_mode  (string|null) → privacy_mode
	 *   input         (string|null) → input
	 *   output        (string|null) → output
	 *   client_id     (string|null) → client_id
	 *   client_name   (string|null) → client_name
	 *   error_message (string|null) → error_message
	 *
	 * `failure_stage` names where the invocation died — `short_circuit`,
	 * `input`, `permission`, `execute` or `output` — and stays null on success.
	 *
	 * `privacy_mode` is stamped here rather than left to each caller; see below.
	 *
	 * `status` is classified here for the same reason: an `error` handed in is
	 * re-read through {@see Outcome} so that a truthful negative answer —
	 * `term_not_found` — is stored as `success`, and a policy block — permission
	 * refused, ability switched off — is stored as `warning`, no matter which
	 * writer produced it. Every writer classifies identically instead of each
	 * one carrying its own copy of the rule.
	 *
	 * `ip_address`, `referrer` and `request_id` were dropped from the schema in
	 * 1.4.0. They are deliberately *not* deprecation-wrapped: the mapping loop
	 * has always ignored keys it does not recognise, so an add-on built against
	 * an older Free that still sends them degrades silently instead of erroring,
	 * and that same property is what lets one build of an add-on run against
	 * both the old and the new Free.
	 *
	 * The prune step is gated behind `albert/logging/enabled` so that Premium's
	 * full-history rows are never trimmed by Free's 2-row cap. When Premium is
	 * active it returns false from that filter and handles its own retention.
	 *
	 * @param string               $ability_name The ability identifier.
	 * @param int                  $user_id      The user ID who executed the ability.
	 * @param string               $status       Execution status: 'success', 'warning' or 'error'. Default 'success'.
	 * @param string|null          $error_code   WP_Error code when status is 'error'. Default null.
	 * @param array<string, mixed> $context      Optional extended context. Default [].
	 *
	 * @return void
	 * @since 1.1.0
	 * @since 1.4.0 Context gained `failure_stage` and `privacy_mode`, and lost
	 *               `ip_address`, `referrer` and `request_id`. `privacy_mode` is
	 *               stamped from the active setting when the caller omits it.
	 * @since 1.4.0 An `error` status is reclassified through {@see Outcome},
	 *               which may store it as `success` or `warning`.
