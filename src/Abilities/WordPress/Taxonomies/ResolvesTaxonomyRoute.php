	 * The answer is `rest_get_route_for_taxonomy_items()`. WordPress has
	 * resolved its own routes since 5.9, and this plugin requires 6.9, so
	 * asking core is both available and the only way to be right: it reads
	 * `show_in_rest`, `rest_namespace` and `rest_base` in the same breath the
	 * route registration does, and passes the result through the
	 * `rest_route_for_taxonomy_items` filter that a site uses to move a route.
	 * A hand-rolled copy is a second answer to a question that already has one,
	 * and it drifts.
	 *
	 * Until 1.4.0 there was such a copy, and it asked the wrong question.
	 * `rest_base` was read as "is this taxonomy in the REST API", but it is the
	 * route *name*: `register_taxonomy()` leaves it `false` unless the caller
	 * sets one, and WordPress then serves the taxonomy under its own slug.
	 * Every REST-enabled taxonomy without an explicit base was refused, which
	 * is the common case for a custom taxonomy — WooCommerce registers
	 * `product_cat` with `show_in_rest => true` and no `rest_base`, and it came
	 * back as "not available via REST API" from an ability whose whole job was
	 * to read it.
	 *
	 * A `post_tags => post_tag` alias used to live here too, quietly accepting
	 * a slug that is not a taxonomy on any site. It is gone on purpose. A tool
	 * is reachable only through what it advertises, and quietly accepting a
	 * second spelling makes the advertised contract false: the next caller
	 * guesses `tags`, then `posttag`, and there is no version of that list that
	 * ends. The refusals below name the taxonomy and point at
	 * `find-taxonomies`, so a wrong guess costs one round trip and teaches the
	 * right slug.
	 *
	 * @param string $taxonomy Taxonomy slug.
	 *
	 * @return string|WP_Error Route with a leading slash, or an error naming the taxonomy.
