/**
 * What a setting's value actually is, and whether the site owner still owns it.
 *
 * Before this, every setting that could be overridden in code hand-rolled its
 * own precedence: {@see \Albert\Privacy\PrivacyMode::resolve()} was constant →
 * filter → option → default, {@see \Albert\Media\UploadLinks\UploadLinkService}
 * was filter → option → ceiling, and connection retention was option → default
 * with no override at all. Three chains, three spellings, and only one of them
 * told the Settings screen it was in force — so a site filtering the privacy
 * mode showed the *stored* value on screen and let somebody save over it,
 * which is a lie about what the site does.
 *
 * The chain, highest priority first:
 *
 * 1. **A PHP constant** named after the option in upper case, so
 *    `albert_privacy_mode` is set by `ALBERT_PRIVACY_MODE`. This is how a
 *    `wp-config.php` pins a value across a fleet.
 * 2. **The filter `albert/settings/value/{option_name}`**, which returns null
 *    to defer — the same idiom as `albert/privacy/mode` and
 *    `albert/media/upload_link_max_bytes`, both of which now feed this chain.
 * 3. **The stored option**, and failing that the caller's default.
 *
 * **Deliberately knows nothing about the settings schema.** Resolution happens
 * on MCP and front-end requests, and reading the schema means firing
 * `albert/settings/register`, which would run every add-on's registration
 * callback on requests that will never render a form. So this is a resolver
 * over an option *name*, nothing more. {@see Storage} is what makes the
 * *stored* value trustworthy; this is only about which layer wins.
 *
 * **And that is why this is not in `Admin\`.** It lived at
 * `Albert\Admin\Settings\Value` while `PrivacyMode`, `AllowedUsers`,
 * `ConnectionRetention` and `UploadLinkService` all read through it, which put
 * an `Admin` namespace in the path of every MCP request and both cron sweeps.
 * It also sat a `Settings` namespace beside the `Albert\Admin\Settings` page
 * class, which PHP allows and nobody enjoys. Settings resolution is its own
 * bounded context; the form that edits them is the admin's.
 *
 * **A constant is a global name.** `albert_privacy_mode` becomes
 * `ALBERT_PRIVACY_MODE`, and nothing reserves that space: an option named
 * `myplugin_debug` binds to whatever `MYPLUGIN_DEBUG` already means on the
 * site. Namespace option names the way Albert does. A declared validator is the
 * safety net when one collides, since an unusable value is skipped rather than
 * pinning the site.
 *
 * **A validator belongs to the option, not to the call site**, and is reachable
 * from the option name alone: {@see Validators} for Free's own, and
 * `albert/settings/validator/{option_name}` for anybody else's. The reason is
 * that every caller has to reach the same verdict. When the rule lived at the
 * call site, {@see \Albert\Privacy\PrivacyMode::resolve()} applied one and the
 * Settings screen did not, so `define( 'ALBERT_PRIVACY_MODE', 'bananas' )` made
 * the screen render the field read-only, showing `bananas` and naming the
 * constant, while the site went on running the stored mode. The screen locked
 * an owner out of a setting the constant did not control, which is the exact
 * failure this class exists to prevent. An explicit `$validator` argument still
 * wins, for a caller with a narrower question than the option's own.
