 * Three things need this list and must all see the same one: the screen that
 * renders the form, the handler that saves it, and {@see Storage}, which hands
 * every field to WordPress's `register_setting()`. It was previously private to
 * the screen, which is why it is here rather than there.
 *
 * **Memoised, and that is load-bearing rather than an optimisation.**
 * `SettingsRegistry::append_field_to_section()` appends — it does not replace —
 * so an add-on calling `albert_register_setting()` on the
 * `albert/settings/register` action contributes its field once per firing. With
 * a second caller collecting in the same request, that action would fire twice
 * and every simple-API field would render, and save, twice over. Collecting
 * once also honours what an add-on reasonably assumes: that its registration
 * callback runs once per request.

	 * `$_POST` key as `option_name ?? {section_id}_{field_id}`. Every field that

	 * from the screen at all.
