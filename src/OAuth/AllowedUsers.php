/**
 * AllowedUsers class
 *
 * The single reader/writer of `albert_allowed_users`: the list of people who
 * may complete an OAuth authorisation, checked at
 * {@see \Albert\OAuth\Endpoints\AuthorizationPage::handle_authorization()}.
 *
 * Stored keyed by user id, each entry carrying `added_at` (when they were
 * granted the standing invitation), `authorised_at` (when they first
 * actually used it, null until then), and `expires_at`:
 *
 *     [ 42 => [ 'added_at' => 1755765600, 'authorised_at' => null, 'expires_at' => 1755852000 ], ... ]
 *
 * `expires_at` is computed once, at {@see self::add()}, from the expiry
 * window in force *at that moment* ({@see self::EXPIRY_OPTION}), and stored
 * as an absolute timestamp, not recomputed from the live setting on every
 * check. An invitation's deadline is a property of that invitation, decided
 * when it was granted: if the owner later tightens or loosens the window,
 * every invitation already waiting keeps the deadline it was given. Silently
 * moving someone's deadline because an unrelated setting changed would be a
 * surprise no security control should spring on someone.
 *
 * {@see self::reset_expiry_clock()} recalculates them deliberately, but is
 * programmatic only. It was briefly offered as a checkbox on the Settings
 * screen and removed in 1.4.0: "apply to invitations already waiting" asks the
 * owner to reason about the difference between a window and a deadline in
 * order to tick a box, which is a distinction the screen should simply make
 * for them.
 *
 * Before 1.4.0 this was a flat array of ints with no timestamps at all.
 * {@see \Albert\Database\Installer} migrates existing sites once, on
 * upgrade, before any of these methods can run in the same request (its
 * `maybe_upgrade()` fires first in {@see \Albert\Core\Plugin::init()}), by
 * leaving every field `null`: there is no record of when a legacy entry was
 * actually added or whether it was ever exercised, and inventing either
 * would be stating a fact nobody knows, displayed as one right on the row
 * ("Added 2 hours ago" for an account that predates this feature entirely
 * is not a rounding error, it is simply wrong). A migrated entry is exempt
 * from expiry the same way a fresh one with expiry turned off is: `null`
 * `expires_at` alone, {@see self::is_expired()}, needs no fabricated
 * `authorised_at` to back it up. Fields are still read defensively here in
 * case an entry somehow predates even that migration.
 *
 * `authorised_at` is the exemption for entries that *do* have a real one: an
 * invitation that was exercised at least once is allowed forever, no matter
 * what happens to that connection later or what its `expires_at` says,
 * checked nowhere but here.
 *
 * Invitation expiry is enforced live, at {@see self::is_allowed()}, not only
 * by the sweep. The same reasoning already applies to token expiry
 * (docs/features/31-connections.md §4): whether a stale row has been
 * physically removed yet is bookkeeping, not the security boundary. An
 * invitation past its stored `expires_at` is refused the moment somebody
 * tries to use it, whether or not {@see \Albert\Cron\AllowedUserExpiry} has
 * run since it expired. The cron exists to keep the stored list tidy, not to
 * be the thing standing between an expired invitation and a connection.
