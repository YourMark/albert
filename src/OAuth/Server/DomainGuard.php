/**
 * Suspends a connection when the site's address changes underneath it.
 *
 * Cloning production to staging copies the database, and the database is where
 * the access and refresh tokens live. Without this, the clone answers a live
 * assistant's requests with real data and real write access, and nobody is told.
 * That is not a convenience problem; it is the single way an authorised
 * connection ends up pointed at a site its owner never authorised.
 *
 * So each client records the host it was authorised against, and every token
 * validation compares that to the host the site answers as now. A mismatch
 * **suspends** rather than revokes, and the distinction is the whole design:
 *
 *  - *Revoked* is a person's decision, made on the Connections screen, and
 *    reconnecting means going through the whole authorisation again.
 *  - *Suspended* is the site noticing something it cannot interpret on its own.
 *    The fix is an administrator saying "yes, that move was us", so it has to be
 *    reversible without the assistant re-authorising, or every legitimate domain
 *    migration would cost every connected user a reconnection.
 *
 * A client with no recorded host is never suspended. That covers connections
 * made before this shipped: suspending them all on upgrade would punish every
 * existing user for a migration that never happened. They record their host the
 * next time they are authorised.
