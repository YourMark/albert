 * unknown to `get-skill` is worse than an unlisted one, the assistant asks for
 * it and is told it does not exist.
 *
 * Registration is data, not code: an add-on hands over an array and the registry
 * builds the {@see Skill}. That is what lets the WooCommerce skill ship from
 * `albert-woocommerce` without that plugin knowing anything about how the index
 * is rendered or how the body is fetched.
 *
 * Bundled skills are read from the plugin's own `skills/` directory, taking
 * their slug, summary and preconditions from the file's frontmatter. A file is
 * the natural home for a body; the registry is what makes it conditional.
