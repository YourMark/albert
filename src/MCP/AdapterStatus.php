 *
 * Both "absent" and "present but older than Albert expects" end in the same
 * symptom: no MCP server registers, and `/albert/v1/mcp` answers
 * `401 rest_forbidden` — which is also the correct response for a healthy
 * install handed no token. Nothing outside the site can tell those apart, so a
 * site owner debugging it reaches for their token, their client and their proxy
 * before suspecting the plugin. This class exists so they are told instead.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately *not* here: any notion of a conflicting second
 * copy. Albert loads the library through Jetpack Autoloader, which resolves one
 * newest copy of `WP\MCP\` across every plugin that ships it. Sharing is the
 * supported arrangement, so another plugin bundling the adapter is normal and
 * not something to warn about.
 *
 * @since 1.4.0
